### Hey there! 👋 I'm Paper, and here's a little about me:

- **💻 Passionate Coder:** I love diving deep into binary arithmetic, developing random ideas I have into games, and experimenting with implementing game mechanics like Tetris and chess bots.

- **🎮 Game Developer:** Currently working on these cool projects:
  - **Baconwaffle.py**: A script that finds the shortest path between two Wikipedia articles.

- **🎨 Magic** (The Gathering, of course 😎): Designing custom cards based on Ultrakill characters, blending strategy with chaotic destruction.

Feel free to check out what I'm working on and say hi! 😄
